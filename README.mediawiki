== Introduction ==

These are the core ontologies used by different parts of the [http://techwiki.openstructs.org/index.php/Open_Semantic_Framework Open Semantic Framework]. These ontologies should be loaded in [http://techwiki.openstructs.org/index.php/StructWSF structWSF] using the structOntology [http://techwiki.openstructs.org/index.php/ConStuct conStruct] module as described in the [http://techwiki.openstructs.org/index.php/StructWSF_Installation_Guide#STEP_14:_Import_Ontologies structWSF installation manual].

Some of the ontologies have been developed specifically for OSF such as:

# SCO (Semantic Component Ontology)
# WSF (Web Services Framework Ontology)
# irON (Instance Record and Object Notation Ontology)

Other ontologies have been developed by others, but are saved here for conveniancy, such as:

# RDF
# RDFS
# OWL

Finally, some ontologies have been developed by others, but modified for the Open Semantic Framework's purpose, such as:

# WGS84 (for which we added SCO annotations to some of its datatype properties)
